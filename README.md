## Features

- üöÜ **Real-time Train Tracking**: View the current locations of all trains in Finland
- üîç **Precise Search**: Find specific trains by ID with exact matching
- üîÑ **Auto-refresh**: Data updates automatically every 30 seconds
- üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Map**: Clean and intuitive map interface with color-coded train markers
- üìä **Train Statistics**: View counts of moving and stationary trains
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## How It Works

This application connects to the Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency's GTFS-RT (General Transit Feed Specification - Real Time) API to fetch real-time data about train positions. The data is parsed and displayed on an interactive map, with additional information available when clicking on train markers.

- **Moving trains** are shown with **blue** markers
- **Stationary trains** are shown with **red** markers

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supaizjy0321/Finland_train_tracker_python.git
cd Finland_train_tracker_python
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install packages individually:

```bash
pip install dash plotly pandas requests gtfs-realtime-bindings
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

```bash
python train_tracker.py
```

### Step 5: Access the Application

Open your web browser and go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8050/
```

## Using the Application

1. **View All Trains**: When you first load the application, you'll see all active trains on the map
2. **Understand the Colors**: Blue markers represent moving trains, red markers are stationary trains
3. **Search for Trains**: Use the search box in the sidebar to find specific trains by ID (exact matching is used for precise results)
4. **View Train Details**: Click on any train marker to see detailed information including speed and route
5. **View Statistics**: The sidebar shows total counts of trains and their status
6. **Manual Refresh**: Click the "Refresh" button to update the data immediately
7. **Auto-refresh**: Data automatically updates every 30 seconds

## Note for Developers

This application includes configuration files (Procfile, runtime.txt) that enable deployment to cloud platforms like Heroku. These files don't affect local usage and can be ignored if you're running the application locally.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the application by modifying the following:

- **Refresh Rate**: Change the `REFRESH_INTERVAL` variable in `train_tracker.py` (default is 30 seconds)
- **Map Center**: Adjust the `FINLAND_CENTER` coordinates in `train_tracker.py`
- **Appearance**: Modify the CSS in `assets/style.css` to change colors, sizes, and layout

## Technology Stack

- **[Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)**: Python framework for building web applications
- **[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)**: Interactive visualization library with MapLibre integration
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **[GTFS-RT](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime)**: Protocol Buffers for real-time transit data
- **[Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/)**: HTTP library for API communication
